# Insights from Customer Behaviors Analysis
## Interest vs. Consumption
By this assignment, I will attempt to extract some insights from a survey of 63 classmates about their interest and consumption.
The survey provides the following data fields;
* Gender
* Age
* Date of Birth
* List of Interest Topics (7-likert scale)
* List of Consumption (6-likert scale)
* Open answers of personal interests (free text)

There are several questions I would like to figure out from the survey, such as the variance between genders, the relationship between age ranges and their consumptions, the degree of linkage between their interest and consumptions, etc.
