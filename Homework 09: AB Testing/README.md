# A/B Testing
We felt challenged to conduct an A/B Testing within 10-15 minutes.
We decided to test if the new logo of fast food "Burger King" positively impacts on a higher frequecy of consumptions.
## 1. Survey
We designed two set of questionnaires. Each was different only in display of Burger King's logo; old vs. new. We administered the questionnaire to two groups of potential customers, approximately 30 persons each. These two groups were similar to each other in term of demography (gender, age, occupation, etc.). The first group was surveyed with the old logo, and the second group the new one. We used Line application as a survey channel.
We asked participants three questions. 
* Their frequency of consuming a Burger King
* Their like/dislike towards the brand
* Their 10-scale rating on tendency of purchasing a Burger King upon seeing the logo displayed

## 2. Response
We received 41 replies, accounting for 68.33% of response rate. We found that the majority of respondents (over 80%) purchased a Burger King several months a time.

## 3. Result
According to the result from both groups, it seems those with a low purchase frequency gave a higher score on a purchase tendency upon seeing the logo displayed. This might be interpreted that a frequent client of Burger King may not pay much of attention on the logo itself. In general, a purchase tendency higher score
